# Cardio Rehab - Sligo, Ireland

## The Cardio Rehab website is a site for people who have had Cardiac Health issues, and might be in need of encouragement to meet people for coffee and arrange for some form of exercise/physical rehabilitation.

- The site is simply where someone can sign-up for an information newsletter.
- The idea is not to PUSH a whole new lifestyle on anyone, simply to give people options.
- The newsletter shows people they are not alone and where to go to talk.
- The Cardio Rehab website also puts people in touch with Cardio-Rehab professionals.

## Users of this site who signup will be given information about physical rehab as well as meetings for like-minded people in a similar situation.
